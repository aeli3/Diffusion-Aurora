## Introduction

This project implements a diffusion model trained to generate realistic aurora borealis (northern lights) images. By leveraging the power of deep learning and diffusion processes, we can create beautiful, high-resolution images of this natural phenomenon.

## Features

- Generate high-quality aurora borealis images
- Customizable image resolution
- Control over diffusion steps for quality-speed tradeoff
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- Pre-trained model weights included

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aurora-diffusion.git
   cd aurora-diffusion
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the model or extend its capabilities. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for bugs and feature requests.

I've created a README markdown for your aurora borealis diffusion model project. The content includes an introduction, features, installation instructions, usage guide, information about the model architecture and training data, a results section (featuring the 0049.png image you mentioned), and sections for contributing and licensing.

Would you like me to explain any part of this README in more detail or make any modifications?
